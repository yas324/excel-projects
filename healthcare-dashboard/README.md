# Healthcare Analysis Dashboard - Excel 


## üìå Overview

This project is an **Excel-based interactive Healthcare Analysis Dashboard** designed to provide a holistic view of healthcare performance. It summarizes **patient demographics, doctor workload, visit types, diagnoses, treatment costs, lab results, and geographic spread**. Slicers allow quick exploration by Gender, Diagnosis, State, Treatment Name, and Visit Type.
The dashboard uses **Power Pivot with DAX formulas** to calculate KPIs dynamically, making it fully responsive to slicer filters.

        Lab_result[Test Result] = "Abnormal"
    ) / COUNT(Lab_result[Lab Result ID])

-- Follow-Up Rates
Follow-Up-Rate =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Visit[Follow Up Required]),
        Visit[Follow Up Required] = "Yes"
    ) / COUNT(Visit[Visit ID])

Follow-up-rate2 =
