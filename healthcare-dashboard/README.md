# Healthcare Analysis Dashboard - Excel 


## 📌 Overview

This project is an **Excel-based interactive Healthcare Analysis Dashboard** designed to provide a holistic view of healthcare performance. It summarizes **patient demographics, doctor workload, visit types, diagnoses, treatment costs, lab results, and geographic spread**. Slicers allow quick exploration by Gender, Diagnosis, State, Treatment Name, and Visit Type.
The dashboard uses **Power Pivot with DAX formulas** to calculate KPIs dynamically, making it fully responsive to slicer filters.

## 🧮 DAX Measures Used

```DAX
-- % of Abnormal Lab Results
% of Abnormal Lab Results =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Lab_result[Result]),
        Lab_result[Result] = "Abnormal"
    ) / COUNT(Lab_result[Lab Result ID])

% of Abnormal Lab Results2 =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Lab_result[Test Result]),
        Lab_result[Test Result] = "Abnormal"
    ) / COUNT(Lab_result[Lab Result ID])

-- Age Groups
0-18 =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Patient[Patient ID]),
        Patient[Age] <= 18
    )

19-30 =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Patient[Patient ID]),
        Patient[Age] > 18 && Patient[Age] <= 30
    )

31-45 =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Patient[Patient ID]),
        Patient[Age] > 30 && Patient[Age] <= 45
    )

46-60 =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Patient[Patient ID]),
        Patient[Age] > 45 && Patient[Age] <= 60
    )

61-75 =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Patient[Patient ID]),
        Patient[Age] > 60 && Patient[Age] <= 75
    )

76+ =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Patient[Patient ID]),
        Patient[Age] > 75
    )

-- Average Age
Avg Age of Patients =
    AVERAGE(Patient.DATEDIFF(Patient[Date of Birth], TODAY(), YEAR))

-- Doctor Workload
Doctor Workload =
    COUNT(Visit[Visit ID]) / COUNT(Doctor[Doctor ID])

-- Follow-Up Rates
Follow-Up-Rate =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Visit[Follow Up Required]),
        Visit[Follow Up Required] = "Yes"
    ) / COUNT(Visit[Visit ID])

Follow-up-rate2 =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Visit[Follow-up Required]),
        Visit[Follow-up Required] = "Yes"
    ) / COUNT(Visit[Visit ID])
```

## 📈 Key Insights (from the snapshot)

* **Balanced Visit Mix:** Specialist consultations, follow-ups, routine checkups, and emergencies are all \~2.4–2.6k—indicates diversified service utilization.
* **Mid-Age Concentration:** Largest patient groups are **31–45** and **46–60**, useful for chronic disease management programs.
* **Cost Drivers:** A handful of treatments (e.g., **Physical Therapy, Antibiotics, Metformin**) dominate spend—ideal targets for vendor negotiations and care pathway optimization.
* **High Follow-Up Rate (\~50%):** Indicates strong continuity of care; pair this with **% Abnormal Labs (\~49%)** to audit test ordering and follow-up protocols.
